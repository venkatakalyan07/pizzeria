🍕 Pizzeria – MEAN Stack Full-Stack Application
This project is a full-stack web application developed using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js).
It simulates an online pizza ordering system where users can browse pizzas, view ingredients and toppings, and interact with a modern UI built using Angular.

The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, providing RESTful APIs for handling pizza data stored in MongoDB.
The frontend is developed using Angular, leveraging components, services, RxJS, and HTTP client modules for seamless communication with the backend.

The application demonstrates key full-stack development concepts such as:

Client-server architecture

REST API development

Database integration with MongoDB

Asynchronous data handling using RxJS Observables

Modular and component-based frontend design

Each pizza item includes details like name, type (veg / non-veg), price, description, ingredients, toppings, and images.
Nested data such as ingredients and toppings are properly handled and rendered using Angular structural directives like *ngFor.
Special attention has been given to:

Error handling

Image fallback handling

Dynamic rendering of complex JSON objects

Clean UI layout using CSS and Bootstrap styles

The project also showcases:

Angular services for data fetching

Dependency Injection

Observable streams and subscriptions

Separation of concerns between UI and business logic

Images are sourced from hotlink-friendly CDNs or local assets to ensure reliability and avoid broken UI issues.
The application follows best practices commonly used in real-world MEAN stack applications.

This project is ideal for:

MEAN stack learning

Full-stack practice

Angular + MongoDB integration demos

Academic and training purposes
